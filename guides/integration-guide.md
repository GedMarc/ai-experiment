2. Use event-driven communication via message brokers
3. Implement resilient communication patterns
4. Set up distributed tracing

## Frontend-to-Backend Integration

1. Configure API gateways
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Set up proper error handling
4. Use reactive patterns for real-time updates

## Testing Integration Points

1. Create integration tests with Testcontainers
2. Implement contract testing
3. Set up end-to-end testing
4. Monitor integration points in production

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure proper versioning
2. Implement blue-green or canary deployments
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Document integration points
