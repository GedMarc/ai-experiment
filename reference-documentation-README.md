# ðŸ“– AI Experiment - Reference Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive reference documentation for the AI Experiment project. The documentation is organized according to the Pact Chain defined in the PACT.md file: Rules, Guides, and Implementation.

## Documentation Files

- [**Reference Rules**](reference-rules.md): A comprehensive reference for all rules, guidelines, and implementation details in the AI Experiment project.
- [**Application Rules Reference**](application-rules-reference.md): A reference for application-level rules and guidelines, focusing on rules specific to applications in the `apps/` and `experimental-apps/` directories.
- [**Implementation Reference**](implementation-reference.md): A reference for implementation details, focusing on the practical implementation aspects as defined in the `implementation/` directory.
- [**Guides Reference**](guides-reference.md): A reference for guides and walkthroughs, focusing on contextual walkthroughs and module blueprints as defined in the `guides/` directory.

## Purpose

These reference files are designed to provide a comprehensive and organized view of the documentation scattered across various .md files in the project. They serve as a single source of truth for rules, guidelines, and implementation details, making it easier to understand and follow the project's standards and practices.

## Organization

The documentation is organized according to the Pact Chain defined in the PACT.md file:

1. **Rules**: Define platform-level boundaries, contracts, versions, and principles.
2. **Guides**: Contextual walkthroughs and module blueprints including use cases, diagrams, and data flow.
3. **Implementation**: Language- and runtime-specific details with full implementation strategy.

Each reference file focuses on a specific aspect of the project:

- **Reference Rules**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all rules and guidelines in the project.
- **Application Rules Reference**: Focuses on rules specific to applications.
- **Implementation Reference**: Focuses on practical implementation details.
- **Guides Reference**: Focuses on contextual walkthroughs and module blueprints.

## How to Use

1. Start with the [Reference Rules](reference-rules.md) to get a comprehensive overview of the project's rules and guidelines.
2. If you're working on an application, refer to the [Application Rules Reference](application-rules-reference.md) for application-specific rules.
3. If you're implementing a specific feature, refer to the [Implementation Reference](implementation-reference.md) for practical implementation details.
4. If you need guidance on a specific topic, refer to the [Guides Reference](guides-reference.md) for contextual walkthroughs and module blueprints.

## Maintenance

These reference files should be updated whenever new rules, guidelines, or implementation details are added to the project. The goal is to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date reference for the project's documentation.
